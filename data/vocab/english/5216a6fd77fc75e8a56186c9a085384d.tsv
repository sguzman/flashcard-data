Usage	in informal english only is usually placed between the subject and verb regardless of what it refers to (e.g. I only want to talk to you); in more formal english it is often placed more exactly, esp. To avoid ambiguity (e.g. I want to talk only to you). In speech, intonation usually serves to clarify the sense.
